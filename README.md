# Ignorance Blocker

In a day when fake news is spreading, people think vaccines actually cause autism, and Alex Jones is still taken seriously, we all need to be reminded of what sites are legit and which ones should be ignored. Though the people installing this extension almost certainly don't need it, a little self-protection never hurt anyone.

All blacklisted and whitelisted sites can be viewed in their appropriate files (blacklist.txt, whitelist.txt).

Do you want your site whitelisted? Send an email to [Greg Garnhart](mailto:greg.garnhart12@gmail.com).
