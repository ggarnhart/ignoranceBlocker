# Ignorance Blocker

In a day when fake news is spreading, people think vaccines actually cause autism, and Alex Jones is still taken seriously, we all need to be reminded of what sites are legit and which ones should be ignored. Though the people installing this extension almost certainly don't need it, a little self-protection never hurt anyone.

# Methodology
## Blacklisting
Blacklisted sites come from Wikipedia's list of unreliable sources, a [CBS Gallery](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/dont-get-fooled-by-these-fake-news-sites/) on fake news sites, and will eventually encompass the entire list of fake news websites found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fake_news_websites). Eventually, sites targeting the Anti-vax movement, the flat earther movement, and other movements will be targeted as well. Sites targeting the white-supremacy movement, genereal terrorism, and the like will be automatically redirected in a future update.

## Whitelisting
Whitelisted sites come from a published list of trusted sources from Forbes.com. Ironically, Forbes did not make the list becuase of [Wikipedia's note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Potentially_unreliable_sources#News_media) on paid "contributers". That said, Forbes is not blacklisted.

All blacklisted and whitelisted sites can be viewed in their appropriate files (blacklist.txt, whitelist.txt).
